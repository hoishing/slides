this repo contains slides converted from markdown files using [marp] and [marp-to-pages]

[marp]: https://github.com/marp-team/marp
[marp-to-pages]: https://github.com/ralexander-phi/marp-to-pages

# why use markdown for presentation

- focus on content instead of artistic design
- github integration
  - use git to track changes
  - pull requests to collaborate
  - deploy as website automatically
  - use github issue for problems / discussion

- harness markdown ecosystem
  - integrate with note taking system, eg obsidian
  - full text editor support, eg vscode
  - easy convert to all formats, eg. pdf, pptx...
